Make a general research about how Machine Learning service providers (DRAG & DROP ONLY) works (how the architecture looks like)
Platforms:
Databricks
Vertex AI
SageMaker
AzureML(Done)


1. CHECK EACH PART OF THEIR SOFTWARE 
2. Check what it does in detail
3. compare with another software's parts

//
Check Architecture for:
Sagemaker
Apache Spark
Snowflake

Found a guide to build a ML pipeline.
Build GUI on Angular.
How to connect a built ML pipeline to a Drag and drop interface? What Python libraries are required? What else is required?

2. Cost model for all 3

3. check if database can be run on amazon/google/microsoft cloud platform and for ML framework and Python
4. Check if docker/kubernates is supporteb by amazon/google/microsoft
9. compatability back-end stack with 3 cloud providers
10. Margin on running cloud for data bricks and snowflake on amazon/google/microsoft.
